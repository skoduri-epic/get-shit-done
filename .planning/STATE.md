# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-19)

**Core value:** Claude understands your codebase structure and conventions before it starts working — automatically
**Current focus:** v1.9.0 Codebase Intelligence System

## Current Position

Phase: 5 of 5 (Subagent Codebase Analysis)
Plan: 1 of 2
Status: In progress
Last activity: 2026-01-20 — Completed 05-01-PLAN.md (gsd-entity-generator Agent Definition)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 13
- Average duration: 2.4 min
- Total execution time: 31 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1. Foundation & Learning | 2/2 | 7 min | 3.5 min |
| 2. Context Injection | 2/2 | 4 min | 2.0 min |
| 3. Brownfield & Integration | 3/3 | 6 min | 2.0 min |
| 4. Semantic Intelligence | 5/5 | 13 min | 2.6 min |
| 5. Subagent Codebase Analysis | 1/2 | 1 min | 1.0 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| index.json keyed by absolute path | 01-01 | O(1) lookup for file entries |
| JSON schema with version field | 01-01 | Enables future schema migrations |
| updated=null for initialization | 01-01 | Distinguishes init from update |
| Use heredoc for stdin testing | 01-02 | Pipe chaining has timing issues with async stdin |
| Extract 'default' as export name | 01-02 | Both 'default' and identifier recorded for default exports |
| Read file from disk for Edit tool | 01-02 | Edit only provides old_string/new_string, not full content |
| Regenerate conventions every index update | 02-01 | Detection is fast, avoids staleness issues |
| Skip 'default' in case detection | 02-01 | Keyword, not naming convention indicator |
| Single lowercase words as camelCase | 02-01 | Follows camelCase rules (e.g., 'main', 'app') |
| Use lookup tables for purposes | 02-01 | More maintainable than regex patterns |
| Target < 500 tokens for summary | 02-02 | Minimize context window usage |
| Top 5 directories, top 3 suffixes | 02-02 | Keep output concise |
| Command documents same regex as hook | 03-01 | Consistency between bulk scan and incremental updates |
| generateSummary in intel-index.js | 03-01 | Co-locate all intel generation; regenerate on every update |
| No FK constraints in graph schema | 04-01 | Entities can reference before target indexed |
| Virtual id from JSON body | 04-01 | Flexible node structure with unique constraint |
| Delete-then-insert for edges | 04-01 | Clean replacement removes stale links |
| Singleton WASM instance | 04-01 | Avoids repeated sql.js init overhead |
| 50 file limit per entity run | 04-03 | Prevents context window exhaustion |
| Batches of 10 for Task tool | 04-03 | Balances parallelization with overhead |
| Entity slug: path--segments--file-ext.md | 04-03 | Flat directory with reversible identification |
| LEFT JOIN allows forward references | 04-02 | Edges can exist before target nodes indexed |
| UNION in recursive CTE | 04-02 | Prevents infinite loops in cyclic graphs |
| maxDepth default of 5 | 04-02 | Prevents runaway queries on deep dependencies |
| Query mode read-only | 04-04 | Query actions don't persist to disk, safe operations |
| Default limit 10 for dependents | 04-04 | Prevents huge output for files with many dependents |
| Query routing before Write/Edit | 04-04 | Clean separation between query and indexing modes |
| Intel read in Step 7 with others | 04-05 | Keep all context file reads in one place |
| 2>/dev/null for missing intel | 04-05 | Graceful degradation when summary.md doesn't exist |
| Skip existing entities by default | 05-01 | Prevents overwriting manual edits to entities |

### Pending Todos

- `/gsd:resume-work` decimal phase handling (deferred from v1.8.0)

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 5 added: Subagent Codebase Analysis

### Blockers/Concerns

- `.planning/` is gitignored in GSD repo - intel files created but not committed (expected for project-local data)
